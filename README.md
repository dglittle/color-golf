color-golf
==========

a color decomposition game.
play it here: http://dglittle.github.io/color-golf/

ideas:
- since it's fairly easy to get the big star, maybe make it possible to get multiple big stars.. perhaps after getting the big star, the other stars clear away, and after filling them up again, there could be two big stars overlapping each other. And the overlapping could go in a spiral to support an unlimited number of big stars..
